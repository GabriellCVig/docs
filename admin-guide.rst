Sesam provides both an API and a UI for managing the service and interacting with the running components and the data. This guide explains the features of the administrator user interface.

Connecting to the Service
=========================

By default the Sesam UI is available at: 

	http://service.sesam.io/my-account/admin

if you are using a local installation then the url will be something like:
	
	http://sesam-server/admin

Sesam Management Studio (this should be the main title)

Logging On

You will require the user name and password that you provided when you configure the Sesam service. 

The Home Page
