Strategy
=======
Objectives
----------
- Authenticate, allowing the users in that JWT to access and conduct tasks on that subscription.

Scope
=======
Functional spec
---------------
- Allow user to add a token, choose users in that token by role or email and add a expiry date.
- Allow user to view and delete tokens.


Structure
=======
Information architecture
------------------------
### JWT
UI for creating, viewing and deleting tokens should be under `Subscription > Settings > JWT`.

Interaction design
------------------
### JWT
- UI for creating, viewing and deleting JWT.  
- Creating JWT consists of a form where the user can fill out name, description, roles and expiry. The roles are a text input field with autocomplete.
- Expandable list of all the existing tokens:
  - View name, description, roles, expiry and JWT.
  - Delete tokens
