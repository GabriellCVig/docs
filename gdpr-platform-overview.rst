GDPR platform overview
===========================

With Sesam's GDPR Platform you can handle your company's GDPR responsibilities.

Most of the Sesam's GDPR Platform is regular Sesam Node with some preconfigured Systems, Variables and Pipes. 

You can manage the GDPR Platform as a regular Sesam Node in the `Management Studio <https://portal.sesam.io>`_.
You will have two elements in the left menu that you don't have in a regular Sesam Node.

- GDPR
- GDPR data access portal

The GDPR element enables you to edit configuration settings of your GDPR platform.
It is also the place to handle requests from data subjects if you have a manual workflow.

The GDPR data access portal is the public facing interface of the GDPR platform - this is where the end user - data
subject in GDPR lingo - can log in and manage their GDPR requests, data and consents.
With the GDPR data access portal menu element you manage this access portal.
